"""
"Simon Says" is a memory game where "Simon" outputs a sequence of 10 characters (R, G, B, Y)
and the user must repeat the sequence. Create a for loop that compares each character of the two strings.
For each matching character, add one point to user_score. Upon a mismatch, end the loop.

for i in simon_pattern:
   if user_pattern[user_score] == simon_pattern[user_score]:
      user_score += 1

print('User score:', user_score)
