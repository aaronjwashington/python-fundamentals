# --- Tuples ---

# --- Reading and Writing Files ---

# older, simpler, but more cumbersome syntax for opening files...

f1 = open('/my_path/my_file.txt','a') # opens a file object for appending (don't worry about append mode for OA, just read and write modes)

f1.read() # reads the data from file into a string

f1.write('hello, friend') # writes to file

f1.readlines() # returns a list of strings, with each line of the file as one string entry

f1.close() # closes file 

 

# a better structure for opening files!

  my_lines = []

  for line in f: # looping directly over the file is also OK

    my_lines.append(line.strip()) # this does essentially the same as what f.readlines() would do, except usign the string strip() method here removes newline characters

# when you leave the with/open() block the file closes automatically

 

 

# --- Modules & Python Standard Library---

# The only modules I would focus on for the exam are math and csv

# math

print('The factorial of 3 is: {}'.format(math.factorial(3)))

print('The largest integer less than or equal to 5.6 is: {}'.format(math.floor(5.6))) # 5

print('The smallest integer greater than or equal to 5.6 is: {}'.format(math.ceil(5.6))) # 6

print('3 to the 5th power is: {}'.format(math.pow(3, 5))) # 243.0

print('The math constant e to the power of 3 equals: {}'.format(math.exp(3))) # don't confuse math.exp() with math.pow()

print('The square root of 6 is: {}'.format(math.sqrt(6)))

 

 

# csv

# reading csv and tsv files without the csv module, using plain old IO/filestream methods, is fine...
# with open("filename.txt", "r") as f:
#     # when reading, I grab contents and get out of the open block
#     contents = f.read() # whole file as one big string
#     contents = f.readlines() # a list of line by line strings, WILL have "\n" at the end of each

# but using csv makes it a little easier...

import csv

# the reader() method is the only one I suggest knowing
contents = list(csv.reader(f)) # csv.reader(f, delimiter="\t") for .tsv files... I like to recast the reader as a list. 
# does one more step for us... makes a list (since we recast it) of lists instead of the list of strings we get from readlines()

# [

# ['1', 'Flossie', 'Levey', 'flevey0@jimdo.com', '129.134.226.30'],

# ["2", "Bob"...],

# ...

# ]
